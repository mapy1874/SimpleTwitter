**Simple Twitter** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **25** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:
- [x] User can **sign in to Twitter** using OAuth login
- [x]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  - [x] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  - [x] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
- [x] User can refresh tweets timeline by pulling down to refresh
- [x] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  - [x] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  - [x] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
  - [x] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline
  - [x] Newly created tweet should be manually inserted into the timeline and not rely on a full refresh

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

- [x] User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination
- [ ] Compose tweet functionality is build using modal overlay
- [x] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Using-Parceler).
- [ ] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
- [x] User can **click a link within a tweet body** on tweet details view. The click will launch the web browser with relevant page opened.
- [ ] User can view following / followers list through any profile they view.
- [ ] User can see embedded image media within the tweet detail view
- [ ] Use the popular ButterKnife annotation library to reduce view boilerplate.
- [ ] On the Twitter timeline, leverage the [CoordinatorLayout](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Handling-Scrolls-with-CoordinatorLayout#responding-to-scroll-events) to apply scrolling behavior that [hides / shows the toolbar](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar#reacting-to-scroll).
- [x] User can **open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets**. Persisted in SQLite tweets are refreshed on every application launch. While "live data" is displayed when app can get it from Twitter API, it is also saved for use in offline mode.

## Notes
- At the very beginning I failed to set Gradle synced since it cannot resolve some dependency. By changing some code into a lower version and clean-rebuild-resync, I finall succeed.
- Did not know how to use a comstomized edit icon at first an find the recource in drawable for a long time, but it turned out use recources in mipmap is the right choice.
- Did not unwrap the parceled twitter in TimelineActivity and it take me a while to debug and find the issue
- Stopped at the persistence part for a long time. I tried to resolve it by understanding Room, DAO and the error was at the MyDatabase.java: I did not add SampleModel into entities
- After polishing the login UI, I found I cannot login after click on the login button, which was caused by no network of the phone
